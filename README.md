# tfjs-ts-examples

This is a project as a result of my journey of learning TensorFlow with TensorFlow JS. I have built all the examples in TypeScript designed to have the Model Learning executed on the command line with Node and testing via the Browser with Preact.

## Project Setup

I have tried to simplify the project setup by using lightweight libraries for the node and the browser. The setup is influenced by the following articles:

-   [https://denys.dev/preact-project-with-typescript-and-parcel/](Preact Project with TS and Parcel)
-   [https://m2.material.io/develop/web/getting-started](Material Design Web)
