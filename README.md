# tfjs-ts-examples

This is a project as a result of my journey of learning TensorFlow with TensorFlow JS. I have built all the examples in TypeScript designed to have the Model Learning executed on the command line with Node and testing via the Browser with Preact.

## Project Setup

I have tried to simplify the project setup by using lightweight libraries for the node and the browser. The setup is influenced by the following articles:

-   [https://denys.dev/preact-project-with-typescript-and-parcel/](Preact Project with TS and Parcel)
-   [https://m2.material.io/develop/web/getting-started](Material Design Web)
-   [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/material-starter-kit](Material Design Starter Kit)

## Project Examples

### Making a prediction from 2D Data

Based on this [TensorFlow.js Codelabs Project](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-regression). The model is trained to make predictions from numerical data describing a set of cars.

### Handwritten Digit recognition

Based on this [TensorFlow.js Codelabs Project](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-classfication). The model is trained via node but visualized and evaluated in the browser.
